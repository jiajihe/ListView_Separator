ListView_Separator
==================

Dinamically created Header/Separator for listviews for Android devices


We can make easy ListView headers/separators that are simple to implement in any project. We want to implement the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) system.
I will try to implement a dynamic list display, so that if you have an unknown number of listviews and you want to add them dinamically, this project will become helpful.
